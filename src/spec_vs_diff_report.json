  "summary": "The diff shows implementation of fixed-height placeholders in PitchDisplay, backend syntax fixes (mo:core imports), and project state tracking. All three requirements (REQ-4, REQ-5, REQ-6) appear to have implementation evidence, though actual deployment success cannot be verified from code changes alone.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Successfully build and deploy the application to the Internet Computer",
      "reason": "No deployment logs, build artifacts, or canister deployment configuration changes are present in the diff. The diff shows code changes but does not provide evidence that the deployment actually succeeded.",

    }

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added comprehensive project_state.json tracking system with schema versioning, feature tracking, architectural notes, and clarification modes",
      "reason": "BuildRequest contains no requirement for adding project state tracking, schema versioning, or metadata management systems. This appears to be internal tooling added beyond the scope of fixing deployment and layout issues.",

    {
      "description": "Backend refactored to use mo:core library imports (Map, Text, List) instead of previous import structure",
      "reason": "While fixing imports aligns with REQ-5, the BuildRequest constraint explicitly states 'Keep the single-actor Motoko backend architecture unchanged'. Changing the import library from one system to mo:core represents a structural change not requested.",
