# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix layout shifting issues in the PitchDisplay component and successfully deploy the Music Theory Companion application.

**Planned changes:**
- Verify PitchDisplay component uses fixed-height placeholders ('—' for note, '0 Hz' for frequency) to prevent layout shifts
- Resolve any syntax errors, type mismatches, or missing imports causing deployment failures
- Build and deploy both backend and frontend to the Internet Computer

**User-visible outcome:** The application deploys successfully with stable pitch display that doesn't shift vertically when switching between detected and undetected states.
